NAME
    Plack::Middleware::GepokX::ModSSL - roughly compatible with
    Plack::Middleware::Apache2::ModSSL

SYNOPSIS
     builder
     {
         enable "GepokX::ModSSL",
             vars => [ Plack::Middleware::GepokX::ModSSL->all ];
         $app;
     };

DESCRIPTION
    This middleware attempts to recreate for Gepok, some of the SSL
    information which Apache's mod_ssl would put into the Plack $env hashref.

    It supports the following variables, as defined by
    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_ssl.html>.

    *   `SSL_CIPHER`

    *   `SSL_CIPHER_USEKEYSIZE`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_CERT`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_I_DN`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_I_DN_C`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_I_DN_CN`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_I_DN_Email`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_I_DN_L`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_I_DN_O`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_I_DN_ST`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_M_SERIAL`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_M_VERSION`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_S_DN`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_C`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_Email`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_L`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_O`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_ST`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_V_END`

    *   `SSL_CLIENT_V_START`

    *   `SSL_PROTOCOL`

    Nothing is done by default. You need to tell the module which variables
    you want:

     builder
     {
         enable "GepokX::ModSSL",
             vars => [qw( SSL_CIPHER SSL_CIPHER_USEKEYSIZE )];
         $app;
     };

    If you want it all, then:

     builder
     {
         enable "GepokX::ModSSL",
             vars => [ Plack::Middleware::GepokX::ModSSL->all ];
         $app;
     };

    Though bear in mind that some variables are more computationally expensive
    than others. Cheap ones are: `SSL_PROTOCOL`, `SSL_CIPHER`,
    `SSL_CIPHER_USEKEYSIZE`, `SSL_CLIENT_CERT`, `SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY`.
